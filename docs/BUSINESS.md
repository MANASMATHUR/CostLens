# NakedSaaS — Business Model & Go-to-Market

## Executive Summary

NakedSaaS is a SaaS intelligence platform that strips any software product down to its true cost across three dimensions: what it costs the vendor to run (margin exposure), what it would cost to replicate (build analysis), and what it actually costs the buyer (hidden fee detection). Powered by TinyFish Web Agent's stealth web automation, it accesses data sources no competitor can reach.

## Market Opportunity

**TAM**: $8.2B (SaaS spend management + competitive intelligence + procurement intelligence)
**SAM**: $2.1B (SaaS-specific cost analysis and procurement tools)
**SOM**: $52M (Advanced SaaS cost intelligence, Year 3)

### Why Now?
- SaaS spend per company grew 25% in 2024 — CFOs demanding visibility
- "SSO tax" and hidden fees generating backlash (trending on HN/Reddit monthly)
- Build-vs-buy decisions increasingly complex with AI tools
- VC due diligence requiring deeper technical analysis of portfolio/targets

## Competitive Landscape

| Tool | What It Does | Our Advantage |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Zylo/Productiv | SaaS spend tracking (what you're paying) | We show what you SHOULD be paying + build alternative |
| BuiltWith/Wappalyzer | Surface tech detection | We go 10x deeper with real browser + cost modeling |
| Gartner/G2 | Review aggregation | We mine reviews specifically for cost intelligence |
| Manual analysis | Spreadsheet guesswork | Automated, evidence-based, repeatable |

**Our moat**: TinyFish Web Agent's stealth engine + three-pillar analysis = unique data no competitor can access or replicate.
